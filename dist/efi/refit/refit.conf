#  none      - show all volume badges (default)
#  internal  - hide badges on internal disk volumes only, allowing you to
#              distinguish CDs and occasionally connected external disks
#  all       - never show volume badges

# List legacy options first. When enabled, legacy BIOS based boot options
# (e.g. Windows, Linux via LILO or GRUB) will be listed first. This is
# intended as a quick fix to change the default boot choice until full
