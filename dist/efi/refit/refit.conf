# Hide the volume badge icons in the graphical main menu. There are three
# settings:
#  none      - show all volume badges (default)
#  internal  - hide badges on internal disk volumes only, allowing you to
#              distinguish CDs and occasionally connected external disks
#  all       - never show volume badges (not recommended)
#hidebadges internal

# Hide various user interface elements. Here you can list the names of
# interface elements to hide. Currently supported:
#  banner    - the rEFIt title banner
#  shell     - the EFI shell icon
#  tools     - all EFI tools (currently just the shell)
#  funcs     - built-in functions (about, restart)
#    ('tools' and 'funcs' together hide the complete second row of icons.)
#  label     - text label in the menu
#  hdbadges  - volume badges for internal disk volumes (same as
#               'hidebadges internal')
#  badges    - all volume badges (same as 'hidebadges all'); this setting
#               is not recommended because it won't let you distinguish
#               installed OSes and bootable CDs/DVDs.
#  all       - all of the above, except for 'badges'

# Use text mode only. When enabled, this option forces rEFIt into text mode.

# List legacy options first. When enabled, legacy BIOS based boot options
# (e.g. Windows, Linux via LILO or GRUB) will be listed first. This is
# intended as a quick fix to change the default boot choice until full
# configurability arrives.
