 rEFIt ext2 Driver TODO
========================

Things that need attention:

- Support symbolic links: EFI does not have a concept of symbolic
  links, so they should be resolved within the driver to look like
  hard links.
- Map ctime/mtime/atime timestamps to the EFI_TIME structure.
- Read the block group descriptors once when the file system is
  mounted and store the bg_inode_table field for all groups in the
  volume structure. (Eliminates one block read in Ext2InodeOpen.)
- Check the feature flags in the superblock for DYNAMIC_REV volumes.
- Disable the workarounds for . and .. in Ext2DirOpen.
- Make the dispatchers in file.c permanent.
- Cache more than one block in memory. (Should probably be limited to
  metadata blocks.)
- Support indexed directories, at least by skipping the hash table
  blocks.
- Maybe support forward slashes in addition to backslashes in
  Ext2DirOpen.
