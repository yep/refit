 Building rEFIt
================

To build the rEFIt EFI components, you'll need the EFI Application
Toolkit from Intel. It is available under a BSD license and can be
downloaded from
<http://www.intel.com/technology/efi/toolkit_overview.htm>.

After installing the Toolkit, edit the 'build.cmd' script at the root
of the Toolkit directory tree. Set 'SDK_INSTALL_DIR' to the correct
path for the Toolkit and change 'EFI_APPLICATION_COMPATIBILITY' to
'EFI_APP_110'.

Copy the outer 'refit' directory with the source into the Toolkit's
root directory. To build just the rEFIt components, follow these
instructions:

 * Open a command prompt window that has the paths set for the Visual
   Studio tools. (Visual Studio installs a Start Menu item for this.)

 * Change to the Toolkit's root directory and run 'build bios32'.

 * Change to the 'refit' directory and run 'nmake -f refit.mak'.

After a successful build, the 'refit.efi' file (and others) can be
found in the 'build\bios32\bin' directory.

To build all rEFIt components as part of a complete build, edit the
main 'makefile' appropriately. It should also be possible to build
rEFIt for the IA64 architecture, but this has not been tested at all.
