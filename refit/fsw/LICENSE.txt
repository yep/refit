 File System Wrapper License
=============================

The various parts of the File System Wrapper source code come from
different sources and may carry different licenses. Here's a quick
account of the situation:

 * The core code was written from scratch and is covered by a
   BSD-style license.

 * The EFI host driver was written from scratch, possibly using code
   from the TianoCore project and Intel's EFI Application Toolkit. It
   is covered by a BSD-style license.

 * The ext2 file system driver uses definitions from the Linux kernel
   source. The actual code was written from scratch, using multiple
   sources for reference. The ext2 driver is covered by the GNU GPL.

For more details, see each file's boilerplate comment. The full text
of the GNU GPL is in the file LICENSE_GPL.txt.
